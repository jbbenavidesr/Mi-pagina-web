# Hello, I'm Juan Ber.

Welcome to my webpage. As you can see, this is a work in progress that holds my corner
in the web. Here you'll find my writings, projects, some demos and whatever I
like to show.

For the moment, it is a little ugly and incomplete, but will hopefully become better soon.

If you have any comments, feel free to contact me at jbbenavidesr@gmail.com

Finally, if you'd rather see my content in spanish, you can do it [here](/es/).

## Services

While I get to organize the page and my services, here are some:

-   Webpage and webapp development.
-   Physics, math and programming lessons.
-   Help for learning new stuff in general.
