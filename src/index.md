I'm a physicist and web developer who loves to learn new stuff. I like to solve problems and understand how things work.

I enjoy developing nice stuff which is nice, fast and accessible to as most people as possible. Over all I like that my work is always as good as possible, so even though sometimes responsabilities or deadlines make it hard, I try understand best practices and be consistent with what I do and why I do it.

This is the first version of my webpage, I'm starting this project with help of a [nice starter](https://hylia.website/) and hopefully will develop an awesome corner of me in the web.
